# Black-Scholes-Equation

This project studies the Black-Scholes equation, which is a partial derivative equation, relevant to the field of finance, enabled the calculation of how changes in an option's price correspond to fluctuations in the underlying asset's value. In this project, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) were employed to derive numerical solutions to the Black-Scholes equation for pricing European options.
